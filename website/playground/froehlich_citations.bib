We expand upon this work by providing a survey of existing and emerging water disaggregation techniques, a more comprehensive description of the theory of operation behind our approach, and an expanded analysis section that includes hot versus cold water valve usage classification and a comparison between two classification approaches: the template-based matching scheme used in Froehlich et al. (2009) [53] and a new stochastic approach using a Hidden Markov Model. We show that both are successful in identifying valve- and fixture-level water events with greater than 90% accuracies. We conclude with a discussion of the limitations in our experimental methodology and open problems going forward.},

	abstract = {Abstract To evaluate ubiquitous computing technologies, which may be embedded in the environment, embedded in objects, worn, or carried by the user throughout everyday life, it is essential to use methods that accommodate the often unpredictable, real-world environments in which the technologies are used. This article discusses how we have adapted and applied traditional methods from psychology and human-computer interaction, such as Wizard of Oz and Experience Sampling, to be more amenable to the in situ evaluations of ubiquitous computing applications, particularly in the early stages of design. The way that ubiquitous computing technologies can facilitate the in situ collection of self-report data is also discussed. Although the focus is on ubiquitous computing applications and tools for their assessment, it is believed that the in situ evaluation tools that are proposed will be generally useful for field trials of other technology, applications, or formative studies that are concerned with collecting data in situ.},
